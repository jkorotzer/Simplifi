# Simplifi

Simplifi is an iOS application that aims to eliminate the aggregate 450 billion dollars of lost payroll due to employees misreporting their timesheets. Simplifi only lets employees check into their workplace when they are connected to wifi, and will even automatically connect in case they forget. Simplifi ensures that employees are in their workplace when they say they are, and is guaranteed to be less hassle and yet more accurate than a simple online timesheet!
