# Simplifi

A drastic improvement to the online timesheet, Simplifi aims to eliminate the estimated billions of dollars lost by companies to employees
misreporting the hours they've worked. Simplifi only allows users to check in when connected to their employer's wifi, ensuring that the 
employee is present in the office when he or she checks in. Furthermore, Simplifi allows users to check in automatically, eliminating the 
hassle of manually logging hours.

How to test:

1) On the home screen, select register your "company" and enter the router ip address your device is currently connected to. Remember
the employer id you receive after registering!
2) Sign up with any username and password, and then enter the employer id you just received.
3) You should be automatically checked in and, from here, can clock in and out, see the times logged from your past weeks, and enter and
save any personal details you wish!
